## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The date is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

I have ensured to provide an intuitive user experience with responsive design and error handling for accurate age calculation.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

(Examples of code snippets that I will add from my code)

### Continued development

The Age Calculator App project helped me enhance my skills in form validation, responsive design, and error handling in JavaScript. In future projects, I aim to explore more advanced techniques for animation and user interaction.
