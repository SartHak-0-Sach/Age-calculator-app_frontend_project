## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The date is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

I have ensured to provide an intuitive user experience with responsive design and error handling for accurate age calculation.

### How to setup the project

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using GitHub Desktop or Git Bash:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/SartHak-0-Sach/Age-calculator-app_frontend_project.git
   ```
2. Open the project folder in your code editor.
3. Run the project using a live server extension or deploy it using Netlify, Vercel, or another web hosting and deployment service.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- DOM manipulation
- Vanilla JavaScript

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.

### What I learned

This project requires programmer to be well versed with date and time methods of JavaScript along with DOM manipulation to show error as shown below


<b>js = proud of this function</b>

```
function onError(element, message) {
    const inputControl = element.parentElement;
    const errorDisplay = inputControl.querySelector(".feedback");
    const input = inputControl.querySelector(".form-control");
    const label = inputControl.querySelector(".form-label");
    label.classList.add("color-red");
    input.classList.add("border-red");
    errorDisplay.innerHTML = `<p class="color-red validation-text error">${message}</p>`;
    inputControl.classList.remove("success");
}
```

### Continued development

The continuously learning journey of a programmer never ends. This project made me realize that there are many concepts that I need to work upon including fundamentals like flex-box and its properties, to more complex concepts like working with fetch and async await in javascript. These areas are some that I think I need to work more upon in the upcoming future as they highlight some of the most significant regions of web development that are important for every developer to know of. 

These key points mentioned here will help me grow accountable and consistent towards improving at writing good quality code and be a successful full stack developer one day.

### Useful resources

- [mdn documentation DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand promises, async and await syntax. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Harkirat Singh course notes](https://github.com/SartHak-0-Sach/harkirat-singh-course_code_and_notes) - I have added notes of all lectures along with code and lecture insights of all weeks along with bonus lectures to help you all as much as I can.
- [My development code and notes](https://github.com/SartHak-0-Sach/cwh-web-dev-playlist_code_and_notes) - These are my notes that I made while working on my development skills in initial days and did these courses. Make sure to star the repository if you like it.‚ú®üí´
